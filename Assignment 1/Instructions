The Aam Aadmi Party is undoubtedly Indiaâ€™s greatest start-up. 
The Party is now in power in 2 states/UTs, and won both with historic margins, thrashing all rivals. 
The Party now aims to spread its base across the country (which it did hastily in 2014 and failed), with a view to emerge as the only alternative to BJP and replacing
the Congress as the principal Opposition. The party wants to start this gruelling battle from the state of Gujarat, a place where the BJP and Congress lock horns.

A). Devise a detailed strategy for the party for the upcoming Gujarat Assembly Elections 2022. (This should include but not limited to Strategy, Message, Target Voters,
Target Constituencies and Regions, Star Campaigners and their roles, Important Issues, Steps to create Cadre/Volunteers, Creative Campaign Ideas etc.) 
B). Also draft a 5-point long-term plan, for the party to emerge as the official opposition in the Lok Sabha Elections of 2029.
